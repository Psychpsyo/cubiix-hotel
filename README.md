# Cubiix Hotel
These are client and server for Cubiix Hotel (working title), an html5 "game" based on the Cubiix made by Duskitten.

# How To Contribute
Currently, please don't. This is very early in development so any work done might conflict with plans I currently have.
Once more of the basics are in place I'll be fine with people actually writing code.
